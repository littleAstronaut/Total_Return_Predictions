# Integrating ESG Metrics and Financial Indicators to Predict Total Returns

This study explores the predictive power of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores on long-term stock returns. Sustainable investing, a growing and strategic approach, considers environmental, social, and governance factors alongside traditional financial metrics to identify companies with both positive societal impact and strong financial performance. With the progression of sustainable investing, understanding the financial implications of ESG performance becomes crucial for investors and companies alike. Utilizing historical ESG data and stock returns, our analysis investigates the relationship between ESG components and stock performance, specifically identifying the predictive strength of the individual ESG components --environmental, social, and governance. Drawing on prior research, we address conflicting findings regarding ESGâ€™s impact: while higher scores may reduce systematic risk, they can also align with over-investment theories, suggesting diminishing financial returns. Therefore, this study combines quantitative analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models, providing actionable insights for this project.
